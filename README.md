# Hotel Booking System GUI <br/>
This application was created in my 2nd year of university and as the name suggests, it is a basic hotel booking system with a GUI. <br/>
To run the application, use NetBeans IDE 8.2 with Java SE Development Kit 8 or newer. <br/>
To see screenshots of the application running, check the "GUI Screenshots" folder.
